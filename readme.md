# Hibernate Hydrate #

The primary goal of the [Hibernate Hydrate](https://github.com/arey/hibernate-hydrate) project is to populate a graph of persistent entities and thus avoid the famous [LazyInitializationException](http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.6/javadocs/org/hibernate/LazyInitializationException.html).

## Features ##
